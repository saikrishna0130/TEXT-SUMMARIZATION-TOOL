Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a rapidly evolving field of computer science that focuses on creating machines 
that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. These tasks include reasoning, learning, 
problem-solving, perception, and language understanding. AI has numerous applications, from virtual assistants 
like Siri and Alexa to autonomous vehicles and advanced data analytics. With the advancement of technology, 
AI continues to grow in complexity and capability, leading to innovations in healthcare, finance, education, 
and many other sectors. However, there are also concerns about job displacement, ethical considerations, and 
bias in AI systems, which must be addressed as the field progresses.
