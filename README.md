DESCRIPTION:As part of my internship task at CODTECH, I was assigned to build a Text Summarization Tool using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The primary objective of this task was to create a Python-based solution capable of summarizing lengthy articles into concise and meaningful summaries without losing the core essence of the original content. This tool is particularly useful in todayâ€™s information-rich world where users need to consume large volumes of text efficiently. Text summarization plays a vital role in industries such as journalism, academia, healthcare, and legal services, where quick information extraction from lengthy documents is critical.To develop this tool, I used the Python programming language, which is widely adopted in the field of artificial intelligence and data science due to its simplicity and rich ecosystem of libraries. The key library used in this project is the Hugging Face Transformers library, a state-of-the-art NLP toolkit that provides easy access to powerful pre-trained models. Specifically, I used the "sshleifer/distilbart-cnn-12-6" model, a fine-tuned version of BART optimized for summarization tasks. This model is known for its performance and speed, making it ideal for real-time summarization needs.The tool accepts a block of input text, processes it through the summarization pipeline using the specified model, and outputs a concise version of the original article. The summarization pipeline is initialized using pipeline("summarization", model="sshleifer/distilbart-cnn-12-6"), and the model intelligently selects the key information from the input text based on the maximum and minimum length constraints provided. This process ensures that the generated summary is neither too short to miss out on essential details nor too long to defeat the purpose of summarization.For development, I used Visual Studio Code (VS Code) as my editor platform. VS Code is an efficient and lightweight integrated development environment (IDE) that provides excellent support for Python development. It includes features like IntelliSense, real-time debugging, terminal integration, and support for virtual environments, all of which greatly enhanced my productivity while working on the project.The tool has broad applicability across several domains. In education, it can help students quickly review academic papers or textbook content. In business, it can be used by professionals to summarize reports, proposals, or emails. Journalists and content creators can use it to condense large news stories or blogs for quick publishing. Additionally, it can be embedded into news aggregation platforms, chatbots, and reading apps to improve user experience by providing brief and informative previews of content.Overall, this task not only helped me deepen my understanding of natural language processing and model deployment but also allowed me to work with one of the most powerful NLP libraries in real-world applications. The completion of this project has given me valuable hands-on experience in applying AI-based solutions to automate complex tasks like summarization, reinforcing my skills in Python and modern AI frameworks.
